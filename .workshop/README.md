# Claude Code Workshop

Learn to work effectively with AI coding assistants using a real-world C codebase.

## What is this workshop?

This hands-on workshop uses **Chocolate Doom** (a classic game engine from the 90s) as a playground to learn how to work with **Claude Code** and agentic AI tools. You'll practice:

- Navigating and understanding unfamiliar codebases
- Using AI to explore, analyze, and modify legacy code
- Working with Claude Code features: modes, sessions, slash commands, and more
- Implementing actual game modifications

No prior knowledge of Doom or C is required - that's the point! You'll learn how to onboard to any codebase with AI assistance.

## Prerequisites

**Required:**
- Claude Pro subscription OR Anthropic API key
- [Claude Code CLI](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/overview), Claude Desktop, or Claude Code Web
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/install/) installed

**Optional:**
- [GitHub CLI](https://github.com/cli/cli#installation) - for PR workflows
- [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/) - Python package manager

## Setup

See the platform-specific setup guides:
- [macOS Setup](setup/MACOS-SETUP.md)
- [Linux Setup](setup/LINUX-SETUP.md)
- [Windows Setup](setup/WINDOWS-SETUP.md)
- [Docker Setup](setup/DOCKER-SETUP.md) (no local dependencies required)

## Workshop Structure

The workshop progresses through several phases:

1. **Setup & Orientation** - Get the environment running, explore Claude Code basics
2. **Codebase Exploration** - Learn to navigate and understand unfamiliar code with AI
3. **Feature Implementation** - Apply what you learned to make actual changes
4. **Advanced Workflows** - PRs, code review, complex modifications

## Key Concepts

- **Plan, iterate, finalize** - Work with the agent, not against it
- **Ask Me Anything** - Claude can answer questions about any part of the codebase
- **Divide and conquer** - Break complex tasks into smaller, manageable pieces
- **Context is key** - Provide relevant information without overwhelming the context window
